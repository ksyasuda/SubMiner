# AGENTS.MD

## PR Feedback

- Active PR: `gh pr view --json number,title,url --jq '"PR #\\(.number): \\(.title)\\n\\(.url)"'`.
- PR comments: `gh pr view …` + `gh api …/comments --paginate`.
- Replies: cite fix + file/line; resolve threads only after fix lands.
- When merging a PR: thank the contributor in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Changelog

- User-visible PRs: add one fragment in `changes/*.md`.
- Fragment format:
  `type: added|changed|fixed|docs|internal`
  `area: <short-area>`
  blank line
  `- bullet`
- `changes/README.md`: instructions only; generator ignores it.
- No release-note entry wanted: use PR label `skip-changelog`.
- CI runs `bun run changelog:lint` + `bun run changelog:pr-check` on PRs.
- Release prep: `bun run changelog:build`, review `CHANGELOG.md` + `release/release-notes.md`, commit generated changelog + fragment deletions, then tag.
- Release CI expects committed changelog entry already present; do not rely on tag job to invent notes.

## Flow & Runtime

- Use repo’s package manager/runtime; no swaps w/o approval.
- Use Codex background for long jobs; tmux only for interactive/persistent (debugger/server).

## Build / Test

- Before handoff: run full gate (lint/typecheck/tests/docs).
- CI red: `gh run list/view`, rerun, fix, push, repeat til green.
- Keep it observable (logs, panes, tails, MCP/browser tools).
- Release: read `docs/RELEASING.md`

## Git

- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`. Push only when user asks.
- `git checkout` ok for PR review / explicit request.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit (`reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, …).
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- Avoid manual `git stash`; if Git auto-stashes during pull/rebase, that’s fine (hint, not hard guardrail).
- If user types a command (“pull and push”), that’s consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Big review: `git --no-pager diff --color=never`.
- Multi-agent: check `git status/diff` before edits; ship small commits.

## Language/Stack Notes

- Swift: use workspace helper/daemon; validate `swift build` + tests; keep concurrency attrs right.
- TypeScript: use repo PM; keep files small; follow existing patterns.

## macOS Permissions / Signing (TCC)

- Never re-sign / ad-hoc sign / change bundle ID as “debug” without explicit ok (can mess TCC).

## BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses Backlog.md MCP for all task and project management activities.

**CRITICAL GUIDANCE**

- If your client supports MCP resources, read `backlog://workflow/overview` to understand when and how to use Backlog for this project.
- If your client only supports tools or the above request fails, call `backlog.get_workflow_overview()` tool to load the tool-oriented overview (it lists the matching guide tools).

- **First time working here?** Read the overview resource IMMEDIATELY to learn the workflow
- **Already familiar?** You should have the overview cached ("## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)")
- **When to read it**: BEFORE creating tasks, or when you're unsure whether to track work

These guides cover:

- Decision framework for when to create tasks
- Search-first workflow to avoid duplicates
- Links to detailed guides for task creation, execution, and finalization
- MCP tools reference

You MUST read the overview resource to understand the complete workflow. The information is NOT summarized here.
