## Highlights
### Changed
- Launcher: Removed the YouTube subtitle generation mode switch so YouTube playback always preloads subtitles before mpv starts.

### Fixed
- Launcher: Hardened YouTube AI subtitle fixing so fenced SRT output and text-only one-cue-per-block responses can still be applied without losing original cue timing.
- Launcher: Skipped AniSkip lookup during URL playback and YouTube subtitle-preload playback, limiting AniSkip to local file targets where it can actually resolve anime metadata.
- Launcher: Keep the background SubMiner process running after a launcher-managed mpv session exits so the next mpv instance can reconnect without restarting the app.
- Launcher: Reuse prior tokenization readiness after the background app is already warm so reopening a video does not pause again waiting for duplicate warmup completion.
- Windows: Acquire the app single-instance lock earlier so Windows overlay/video launches reuse the running background SubMiner process instead of booting a second full app and repeating startup warmups.

## Installation

See the README and docs/installation guide for full setup steps.

## Assets

- Linux: `SubMiner.AppImage`
- macOS: `SubMiner-*.dmg` and `SubMiner-*.zip`
- Optional extras: `subminer-assets.tar.gz` and the `subminer` launcher

Note: the `subminer` wrapper script uses Bun (`#!/usr/bin/env bun`), so `bun` must be installed and on `PATH`.
